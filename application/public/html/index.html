        <p> WARSAW, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Major leaks that suddenly erupted in the Nord Stream gas pipelines that run from
            Russia to Europe under the Baltic Sea have generated plenty of theories but few clear answers about who or
            what caused the damage.  <br/> <br/>

            Here is what we know and what has been said so far: <br/> <br/>

            Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency, said it was "very obvious" who was behind it but did not say who that was.</p>
